# Welcome to paste.ml
paste.ml is a Python based, elegant and simple pastebin web service. It takes a
simplistic twist off hastebin.com's beautiful frontend with a little bit more
integration and added features.

## Warning!

The webservice currently hosted at http://paste.ml is very much so in beta status,
and as such, I would not recommend storing any import information within it, as
the backend and front are likely to change, and databases will be wiped prior to
its initial release out in the wild.


##### Guidelines

   * All users with accounts will have their pastes stored forever
   * All guest pastes will be stored for 2 weeks after the last time they were
     accessed
